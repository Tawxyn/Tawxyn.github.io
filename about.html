    <p class="fade-in">
      I'm Mike, a junior software engineer with a B.S. in Computer Science from Sacramento State.
      I'm currently pursuing an M.S. in Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology
      while working full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="fade-in">
    I'm interested in building practical software and tools, with a growing focus on robotics,
    3D printing, and hands-on systems. Outside of work, I enjoy backpacking, off-roading,
    snowboarding, biking around town, and working on cars—anything that blends mechanics,
    creativity, and problem-solving.
